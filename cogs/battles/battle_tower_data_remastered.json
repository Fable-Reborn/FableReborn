Drakath, shifting and chaotic.\n\nBehind them, you see three doors. And then, in the corner of your vision, a fourth door. Hidden. Shimmering. Locked by three keyholes.\n\nElysia speaks: 'Impressive. You've maintained coherence through 44 cycles. Most shatter by 30.'\n\nSepulchure laughs: 'You have three keys. Smart. We were wondering if anyone would figure that out.'\n\nDrakath grins: 'You have a choice to make, mortal. And this time, the choice actually matters.'\n\nYou grip the three keys in your hand. The weight of 44 cycles presses down on you. The memory of Maya burns in your mind.\n\nThe gods wait. The doors wait. Your decision will change everything.\n\n**What will you choose?**",

A younger version, memory wiped, ready to start Cycle 45.\n\nYou try to warn him. The tower won't let you. Your voice comes out as: 'Welcome to the Tower of Ascension.

You're actually winning\u2014\n\nYou deliver the killing blow.\n\nEverything goes white.\n\nYou wake up on Floor 1.\n\nYou still have your divine power. You still remember everything.

You see yourself winning and losing, living and dying, remembering and forgetting.\n\nEvery possibility. Every timeline. All at once.\n\nDrakath's laughter echoes across infinite moments: 'Now you understand. This is freedom. Every possibility, every timeline, all at once. Most go mad instantly. But you? You might survive. Good luck.'\n\nYou're free from the linear cycle. But you're trapped in ALL cycles at once. Forever.\n\n**TO BE CONTINUED...**"

Light spills out\u2014real light, not divine light. Sunlight.\n\nYou step through.\n\n---\n\nYou emerge into a plaza. The sky is wrong\u2014too red, with three suns. Around you stretch thousands of towers, each identical to the one you just left. The God Farm.\n\nBeings wander the plaza\u2014humans, elves, demons, creatures you can't name. All scarred. All broken. All free.\n\nAn old woman approaches. She has 147 notches behind her ear.\n\n'First time Outside?' she asks.\n\nYou nod, unable to speak.\n\n'Welcome to the Harvest Plaza. There are ten thousand towers here. You escaped one.' She gestures to the vast cityscape. 'Where did you think divine power comes from?'\n\nYou look at your hands. 44 scars behind your ear. Maya's name carved into your arm. The three keys crumbling to dust.\n\n'Most people go back in,' she says. 'Can't handle the truth. Some try other towers. It never helps.'\n\n'What do you do?' you ask.\n\n'Some of us fight. Try to shut down the towers. Free everyone. It's not going well. Gods are stronger than we thought. And there are so many of them.' She extends a hand. 'But we could use someone who collected all three keys. That takes someone special.'\n\nYou look back at your tower. New climbers enter, bright-eyed and naive. You think of Maya. Of all the versions of you still trapped inside.\n\n'Tell me everything,' you say.\n\n'It's going to be a long conversation. Come. We have a camp. Others like us. And a plan.'\n\nShe starts walking. You follow.\n\nBehind you, the Battle Tower hums, pulling in fresh souls. The harvest continues.\n\nBut now you know the truth. And you're going to burn it all down.\n\n**TO BE CONTINUED IN: THE GOD FARM**"
